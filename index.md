## Summary
Right now I am Clinical Lead Analyst at Intersystems, responsible for a small
team collaborating with our customers to deploy and configure the clinical
platform. We do so by helping them restructure their processes, aiming at
improving quality of care, addressing operational inefficiencies, minimizing
clinical risks, and trying to make the stakeholders happy.

As part of a career move toward a more product-oriented role, I am also working
with our Product Team, prototyping the new product interface and helping them to prioritise the development based on Customers needs.
I am also involved in developing new functionalities, taking care of all stages, from requirements gathering stage to implementation.

Previously, I worked in various healthcare companies, both in
Italy and the United Kingdom, helping customers achieve their targets and working with them side by side. I also have a more technical past, working on developing interfaces for medical systems and collaborating closely with backend and frontend developers to achieve the best result for the solution, and sometimes working on the backend to fix bugs and develop new functionalities.

I am a very result-oriented person and I love being in teams that include different roles and experiences.
